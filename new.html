          <br />
          On this Rainy Day, I made a lot of mistakes, bringing you in deep sadness.<br />
          Through my constant jeloussness every fight that we make always came from it,
          I can't deny my feelings that it's always in constant agony by seeing you being
          happy with somebody because I know that my pressence alone can't give you enough
          joy. Im very very sorry for always being like this, I guess not being with you
          puts a lot of toll in my mind that it even affects my overall behavior because I 
          know that there's always someone who will take you away from me. With This letter 
          I hope that I can express my feelings for you, I'm not getting mad if your 
          only conversing about work and school stuff but please bare in mind that I'm also
          here, always watching you from afar hoping that you would look at me in the same 
          way that you look at them, also not keeping in mind of your promises makes me feel
          dissapointed and hurt. I wish that you could always think of me when conversing with them
          through that, it will give you a warning that I'm here and always will be, Sorry for everthing.
